# Chess
Chess game written in Python

This is a personal project to code english Chess in Python

 - Need to find a way to integrate movehistlist modified by movehistory() function to determine game conditions
 - Need to complete pawn movements/attacks
 - Is there a way not to hardcode the game board?

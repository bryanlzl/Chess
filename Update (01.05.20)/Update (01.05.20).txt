Update (01/05/2020):
- Created new file for interface of 'vs AI' chess mode, added tweaks, basically a modified human vs human mode interface to take chess AI input (Chess_vs_ai.py)
- Integrated stalematcheck function (checking for stalemate condition) into both interface files

Renamed all files: 
Chess_main_menu.py handling main menu
Chess_vs_human.py handling interface for human vs human mode
Chess_vs_ai.py handling interface for human vs AI mode
Chess_function.py as the program's skeleton (movement/check functions, evaluation of game states, modification of lists/gameboard etc...)

Various bugfixes for Chess_vs_ai.py

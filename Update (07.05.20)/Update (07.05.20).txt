Update (05/07/20):
-- Added AI level 2 --
The level 2 function looks ahead 3 moves to determine the best possible move in the worst case scenario
Unlike level 0 and 1, this uses a Minimax algorithm with a search depth of 3 (3 plies).
*Alpha-Beta Pruning* is used to cut down on the processing time

Further improvements required:
- Optimising of code structure as AI still takes massive durations (~ 5 mins) to process each move
- Increasing search depth without compromising much on processing duration
